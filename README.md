# PONG-JS-NO-LIBS

You can see the game running in action if you open the index.html file in your browser of choice. Only player 1 can be controlled so far using "W" and "S".

Try to get yourself familiar with the code in game.js. There are `//@TODO`s marked in the code. These should be solved to get a fully functioning pong (please fork the repo and complete it).

# DEVELOPMENT

You can further develop this game by opening the HTML file in a browser that supports ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 and ECMAScript 2015. After making changes to the files please make sure you do a hard reload in the browser to see your changes.
